********************************************************
SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
********************************************************
This system requires ELECTRONICS. 

ELECTRONICS require ELECTRICY.

ELECTRICY is DANGEROUS.

It only takes a handful of miliamps across your
heart to stop it.

We take absolutely no responsibility for and do not 
assume any liability for anything that results from 
reading this document and attempting to implement 
the system described within.

THIS INCLUDES THE BREACHING OF A SECURITY SYSTEM,
DEATH OF PEOPLE IMPLEMENTING THAT SYSTEM, AND OTHER
POTENTIAL INCIDENTS TOO NUMEROUS TO LIST.

DEPENDANCIES
********************************************************
Software:
SQLite 3 and the python libraries for it

Hardware:
RFID reader that outputs Weigand-26
Maglock that can be energized with 12 volts
Relay with a two pins that are normally closed
12 volt power supply(old laptop cords work great)
Arduino (Developed on Duemilanove and Uno)

python-script/
	the python script that acts as a maglock server
arduino-stuff/
	arduino sketch and wiring diagram

SETUP
********************************************************
Change the MASTERCARD values in the python script to
a card value you have and a pin you know.

Change the serial port to the port the arduino
shows up on.

Wire up everything like the diagram, plug the Arduino
into a computer, fire up the python script (make sure 
the serial port is set correctly), and start adding
cards to the system.
